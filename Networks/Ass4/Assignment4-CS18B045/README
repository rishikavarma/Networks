Instructions to compile:

The required executables can be obtained by running the makefile using the 'make' command in the terminal. The executables and output files can be cleaned using the 'make clean' command.

Instructions to run and test:

Each set of executables obtained after compilation can be run using the following commands simultaneously on different terminals or machines:

Selective repeat:

./receiverSR -p <port> -N <max packets> -n <sequence bits> -W <window size> -B <buffer size> -e <error rate> -d <debug mode (optional)>

./senderSR -s <IP address/name> -p <port> -L <Max packet length> -R <rate of packet generation> -N <max packets> -W <window size> -B <buffer size> -n <sequence bits> -d <debug mode (optional)>


Go back N:

./receiverGBN -p <port> -N <max packets> -n <sequence bits> -e <error rate> -d <debug mode (optional)>

 ./senderGBN -s <IP address/name> -p <port> -l <Max packet length> -r <rate of packet generation> -N <max packets> -w <window size> -b <buffer size> -n <sequence bits> -d <debug mode (optional)>

It is advised to run the receiver first and then sender as closely as possible.
The port number used is 12345.

The protocols when run will give the following values in the end:

PACKET_GEN_RATE 
PACKET_LENGTH
Retransmission ratio
RTT average


If the debug tag is given, the program will also print additional information pertaining to the times and individual rtt of each  packet as follows:

Sender:

Seq__: Time Generated: __ : __ RTT: __ Number of attempts: __

Receiver:

Seq__: Time Recieved: __ : __

To get the most accurate final values it is advised to run in the debug mode as the prints may cause lags.
